                Learning coding empowers you to do many things you wouldn’t otherwise be able to do. These things
                include hand-crafting your own websites, becoming a career coder or even starting a technology business.
                Most importantly, you’ll be able to understand the technology shaping your world.
                <br>
                <br>
                You’ve undoubtedly heard or read somewhere that everyone needs to learn coding, right? Well, people say
                that for a reason! Whether you’re looking for a career in the industry, starting a new hobby or just
                wanting to understand technology, you can benefit from learning coding.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here are some of the things that learning coding can empower you to do.
            </p>
            <h1>Make your Own Website</h1>
            <p>
                If you own a company, a website presence is a must. If you don't, you may still want a personal blog or
                portfolio platform to market your skills to prospective employers. Of course, the ability to build and
                maintain a website is extremely restricted unless you study the HTML and CSS code that all websites are
                running on.
            </p>
            <h3>Why do people learn code?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>High Salary</li>
                <li>In demand</li>
                <li>You'll improve your logical thinking</li>
                <li>Start a business</li>
                <li>Understand how computers work</li>
                <li>Many more.....</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Connect with friends</h1>
            <p>
                You may also be surprised by just how many of your friends are currently learning to code, or have in
                the past. So share your goals and what you’re working on with your own friends on social media, too!
            </p>

            <h1>Learn new skills and help others at the same time</h1>
            <p>
                For a limited time, we’re matching every Pro membership purchased with 5 memberships donated to people
                that have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19. So if you’ve been thinking about taking the plunge,
                now is a great time to start learning to code and help provide a coding education to five people in
                need.
